    A Festival of Light, Love, and Hope ✨
  </h1>

  <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-center">
    <span class="font-bold text-yellow-800">Jyoti</span> is a heartwarming initiative by the <span class="font-bold text-yellow-800">GYB Club, NIT Patna</span>, celebrated every Diwali to spread the true essence of the festival of lights among underprivileged and orphaned children.
  </p>

  <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-center">
    During this radiant event, our team visits a local orphanage, filling the space with laughter, warmth, and togetherness. We light diyas, share sweets, play joyful games, and create cherished memories with the children. Beyond celebration, we also donate essential items like <span class="font-semibold text-yellow-700">sanitary napkins, mosquito nets, blankets, and study materials</span> to support their daily needs.
  </p>

  <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-center">
    What makes <span class="italic text-yellow-900">Jyoti</span> truly special is the love and care that ensures every child feels valued and celebrated. Instead of evoking pity, our volunteers focus on bringing genuine happiness, bright smiles, and a sense of belonging—making sure no child feels alone during the festival.
