    <strong class="text-pink-700">Sahyog</strong> is a heartfelt initiative by the
    <strong>GYB Club, NIT Patna</strong>, where we come together to spread colors of happiness beyond boundaries.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Every year during Holi, we celebrate this vibrant festival not just with colors, but with compassion. We invite
    underprivileged and orphan children to join us in a day filled with fun, laughter, and love. Whether it’s a
    trampoline park, a waterpark, or a garden filled with joy – we take them to a place where they can experience a
    carefree childhood moment.

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    <strong class="text-pink-700">Sahyog</strong> isn’t just an event – it’s a reminder that true celebration lies
    in sharing smiles. Come, be a part of this beautiful journey of giving and growing together.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800">
    Because the happiest Holi is the one you celebrate with your heart.
