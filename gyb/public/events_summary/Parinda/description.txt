  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-2">
    <strong class="text-green-700">Parinda</strong> is a thoughtful social initiative by
    <strong>GYB Club, NIT Patna</strong>, dedicated to the care and protection of our feathered friends.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-2">
    In the scorching summer heat, when birds struggle to find food, water, and shelter,
    <strong class="text-green-700">Parinda</strong> steps in to offer them comfort. Through this event, we place
    water bowls, grains, and install eco-friendly nests and shelters on trees and rooftops around the campus and city parks.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-2">
    It’s a small step towards a more compassionate world — where humans and nature coexist with care.
    By providing a little relief to birds, we not only support the ecosystem but also awaken a sense of responsibility within ourselves.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800">
    <strong class="text-green-700">Parinda</strong> is not just an event. It’s a message —
    to give wings to kindness and protect those who cannot speak.
