  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-600 mb-4">A Festival of Light and Love</h1>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    <strong class="text-yellow-700">Jyoti</strong> is a beautiful initiative organized by the
    <strong>GYB Club, NIT Patna</strong>, every Diwali, with a simple yet powerful purpose —
    to celebrate the festival of lights with underprivileged and orphaned children.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    During this event, the team visits a local orphanage, spending quality time with the kids —
    lighting diyas, sharing sweets, playing games, and spreading joy. Along with celebrations,
    they also donate essential items like sanitary napkins, mosquito nets, blankets, and study
    materials to support the children's daily needs.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800">
    But what truly makes <strong class="text-yellow-700">Jyoti</strong> special is the heartfelt
    care taken to ensure that the children never feel the absence of their parents during the
    celebration. Instead of making them emotional, the volunteers focus on bringing genuine
    happiness, laughter, and love, making them feel cherished, not pitied.
