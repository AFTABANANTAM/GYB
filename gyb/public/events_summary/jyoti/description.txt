    A Festival of Light and Love – Jyoti
  </h1>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 text-sm">
    Every Diwali, <strong>GYB (Get Your Book) Club, NIT Patna</strong> lights up lives through its heartfelt initiative –
    <strong class="text-blue-700">Jyoti</strong>. This event is dedicated to celebrating the festival of lights with underprivileged and orphaned children, spreading warmth, joy, and love where it's needed most.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 text-sm">
    The team visits local orphanages to spend meaningful time with the children — lighting diyas, playing games, sharing sweets, and creating beautiful memories together. But Jyoti goes beyond just celebration.
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-800 text-sm space-y-1">
    <li><strong>Gifts with Purpose</strong> – Donation of sanitary napkins, mosquito nets, blankets, and study materials to support daily needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Moments of Joy</strong> – Fun-filled activities that bring out smiles, laughter, and light-heartedness.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Care</strong> – Volunteers focus on making children feel loved, not pitied, ensuring they never feel the absence of family.</li>
    <li><strong>A Celebration of Togetherness</strong> – A festival that binds hearts, regardless of background or circumstance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-800 text-sm mt-3">
    What truly makes <strong class="text-blue-700">Jyoti</strong> special is the compassion behind it — creating a space where children feel valued, celebrated, and connected during a time that often highlights what they lack.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 text-sm mt-3">
    Join GYB Club in lighting not just diyas, but lives — with love, joy, and a sense of belonging that shines far beyond the festival.
