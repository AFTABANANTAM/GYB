    Spreading Warmth, One Blanket at a Time
  </h1>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 text-sm">
    As winter chills set in, <strong>GYB (Get Your Book) Club, NIT Patna</strong> steps forward with compassion through its
    <strong class="text-blue-700">Blanket Donation Drive</strong> – an initiative to bring warmth and dignity to those in need.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 text-sm">
    While many enjoy the comfort of cozy homes and thick blankets, countless people in our society face harsh nights without protection. This drive aims to reach the homeless and underprivileged, offering them not just physical warmth, but a message of care and solidarity.

    <li><strong>Direct Impact</strong> – Blankets are distributed to people in slum areas and streets during the coldest months.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Driven</strong> – Students and volunteers come together to collect and distribute blankets.</li>
    <li><strong>More Than Fabric</strong> – Each blanket symbolizes hope, support, and shared humanity.</li>
    <li><strong>Promotes Compassion</strong> – Encourages youth to step into meaningful action beyond campus boundaries.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-800 text-sm mt-3">
    This initiative is a true reflection of kindness in action—where giving is simple, yet its impact is profound. For someone out in the cold, a single blanket can mean the world.
