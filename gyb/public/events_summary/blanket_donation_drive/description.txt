    Spreading Warmth, One Blanket at a Time
  </h1>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    In the chilly months of winter, while many of us find comfort under warm blankets, there are countless people who
    brave the cold with little to no protection. Understanding this harsh reality,
    <strong>GYB Club, NIT Patna</strong> organizes a heartfelt initiative — the
    <strong class="text-red-700">Blanket Donation Drive</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Through this event, the club reaches out to the underprivileged and homeless communities, distributing blankets
    to those who need them the most. It’s not just about offering warmth from the outside, but also showing care,
    compassion, and humanity from the inside.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Each blanket handed out is more than just fabric — it’s a gesture of hope, a symbol of support, and a reminder
    that no one is forgotten.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800">
    This drive reflects the true spirit of giving, where students come together to make winters a little kinder
    for those less fortunate.<br />
    <strong class="text-red-700">Because sometimes, the smallest act of kindness can bring the greatest warmth.</strong>
