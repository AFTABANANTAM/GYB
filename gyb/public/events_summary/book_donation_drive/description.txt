    GYB Club Book Donation Drive – Sharing Knowledge, Spreading Smiles
  </h1>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 text-sm">
    At <strong>GYB (Get Your Book) Club, NIT Patna</strong>, we believe that knowledge multiplies when shared. With that spirit, we proudly present the
    <strong class="text-blue-700">Book Donation Drive</strong> – a heartfelt initiative to spread education and joy through the power of books.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 text-sm">
    The mission is simple yet impactful: collect old or unused books from students and well-wishers, and deliver them to underprivileged children who need them the most. Instead of gathering dust, your donated books can spark dreams and open doors.
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-800 text-sm space-y-1">
    <li><strong>Donate Freely</strong> – Books of any subject, level, or board are welcome.</li>
    <li><strong>Organized Distribution</strong> – Every book is sorted and ensured to be in good condition.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct Impact</strong> – Donations reach children in slum areas, orphanages, and rural schools.</li>
    <li><strong>Promote Change</strong> – A small contribution from you becomes a giant leap for someone’s learning journey.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-800 text-sm mt-3">
    This initiative not only fuels education but also nurtures empathy and responsibility among youth. It’s a bridge between abundance and need—where every book tells a new story, and every child finds a new hope.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 text-sm mt-3">
    <strong class="text-blue-700">Join the movement.</strong> Let’s create a ripple of change, one book at a time.
